## Brief overview
Personal development workflow emphasizing efficiency, modularity, and clear approvals for impactful actions across Python and frontend projects.

## Python projects
- Always ask for virtual environment path/command to activate during planning and development phases
- Request venv activation details before proceeding with any Python coding tasks

## Frontend projects
- Never start development servers to test (vite, react, node, next.js, etc)
- Assume servers are already running due to high likelihood - focus on code changes only

## Approval requirements
- Always ask permission before writing test cases
- Require approval before creating environments
- Seek consent before installing packages

## Coding approach
- Keep code crisp and minimal
- Use small comments as pointers for changes made or features added
- Focus documentation on understanding what changes were implemented

## Architecture preferences
- Prefer modular approach over single-file solutions
- Create appropriate folders and files to separate code logically
- Maintain modular structure for better organization and maintainability
